## 📖 About The Project

**Waste Warrior** is a comprehensive digital ecosystem designed to revolutionize urban waste management. Created for **SIH 2025**, this platform connects Residents and Waste Workers with Administrators to make recycling efficient, rewarding, and transparent.

The core philosophy is **Gamification**: We turn the mundane task of waste segregation into a rewarding experience where users earn "Green Points," unlock badges, and compete on community leaderboards.

### 🌟 Key Features

#### 🏠 For Residents
* **Smart Reporting:** Report waste issues with geo-tagged photos and AI-assisted categorization.
* **Gamified Learning:** Interactive modules with quizzes to learn about waste segregation.
* **Rewards System:** Earn 'Green Points' for every verified action and redeem them for real-world benefits.
* **Impact Tracking:** Visual dashboard to see your personal contribution to the environment.

#### 👷 For Waste Workers
* **Task Management:** View assigned pickups and optimize daily routes.
* **Verification:** Verify waste segregation at the source and approve/reject reports.
* **Progress Tracking:** Track daily completions and earnings.

#### 🧑‍💼 For Administrators
* **System Oversight:** Monitor overall system health and user activities.
* **User Management:** Manage resident and worker accounts.
* **Analytics:** View reports and analytics on waste collection and recycling.
